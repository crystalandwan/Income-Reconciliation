# Income-Reconciliation
High-resolution income projections for Washington state under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are essential for the Grid Operations, Decarbonization, Environmental and Energy Equity Platform, which models the US energy system interactions under decarbonization and assesses its impact on environmental and energy equity. To generate these income projections, we obtain state-level GDP per capita projections and convert them into projected annual household income. The resulting state-level income projections are subsequently downscaled to the census block-level based on the Longitudinal Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) dataset from 2002 to 2015. To assess the accuracy of our approach, we downscale historical income data between 2016 and 2019 from state- level to block-s and block group-level and compare the downscaled result against the actual income data from LODES. The assessment results demonstrate a good agreement (Average R2 of 0.67 and 0.8 for block- and block group-level, respectively) between the downscaled income data and the LODES data, thereby validating the methodology employed. Income projections from our approach under different SSPs for Washington state can be utilized by a broader audience, including those involved in demographic analysis, economic research, and urban planning.
"Income Reconciliation.R" provides code for reconciliating income from  state-level projected decile gdp per capita under different SSPs to block-level household number by 3 income bins (<$18,150; $18,150 ~ $48396, > $48,396). "Accuracy assessment.R" provides code for validating the downscaling method based on LODES 2016 - 2020.
